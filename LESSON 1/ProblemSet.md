# Program: Check Special Number Properties

Write a program that takes an integer **num** as input and performs the following checks:

- If **num** is a perfect square (the square of an integer) **and** a perfect cube (the cube of an integer), print:
  
  **"Perfect in every way"**
- If **num** is a perfect cube and divisible by 2, print:
  
  **"Perfect in even cubes"**
- If **num** is a perfect cube and not divisible by 2, print:
  
  **"Perfect in an odd way"**
- If **num** does not conform to any of the conditions, print:
  
  **"Nothing special"**
